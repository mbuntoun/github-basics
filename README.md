# Github Basics
This guide will provide a step-by-step instructions to setup your github account on your computer, and the basics on how to clone and commit the code.

### I. Setting up SSH key
#### 1. Generate SSH key
`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@aupp.edu.kh"`

This creates:
~/.ssh/id_ed25519 (private key)
~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub (public key)

#### 2. Open and copy your SSH key
Mac: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_new_account.pub | pbcopy`

Windows: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_new_account.pub | clip`


You can also simply open the key and using Ctrl/Cmd+C to copy the key:
`cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_new_account.pub`
The cat command will open and display the public key.

#### 3. Copy your SSH key to github
- Open Github
- Login to your github account (using the email from the SSH key creation earlier)
- Go to Settings -> SSH and GPG keys -> New SSH Key

*You can use any title you want (to identify your computer). If you change computer, you will have to set this up all over again.*
- Add SSH key

Now you can clone the github repo, commit the code using your github account with the email earlier.

### II. Clone the repository
1. From the github repository, copy the ssh url.

2. Go to your prefered folder in your computer.
3. Open Terminal from there.
4. Clone the repository using the ssh url: `git clone git@github.com:mbuntoun/github-basics.git`

### III. Make changes to the repository via VS Code
1. Open the folder in VS Code.
2. Add about_me.txt
3. In about_me.txt, write your name, and a few words to describe yourself.
After making the changes, you will see the changes highlight in VS Code. Then, you can commit the code to github.

### IV. Commit to Github
1. Add your changes: In your terminal `git add .`
2. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "your commit message here"`
3. Push to Github: `git push`
Now you can see the changes in the github repository.

### V. Others
For working with a team, you may want to pull the latest changes first before you add and commit any code:
`git pull`

You can also check the status first before you pull using: `git status`
